# admin-dashboard

This is the "Admin Dashboard" project from The Odin Project. The webpage is a non-functional mockup of an app dashboard.

I used the following skills on this project: CSS grid layout, combining grid and flex layouts, setting css variables, editing svg fill colors, adding box shadows to divs, and importing google fonts.
